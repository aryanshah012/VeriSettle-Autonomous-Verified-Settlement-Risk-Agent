# Contributing to VeriSettle

Thanks for your interest in improving **VeriSettle**.

## Development Workflow

1. Fork or clone the repository.
2. Create a focused branch such as `feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`.
3. Make a small, reviewable change.
4. Run the project checks locally.
5. Use a clear commit message, preferably following Conventional Commits.
6. Open a pull request explaining the problem, approach, testing, and any trade-offs.

## Local Setup

```bash
npm ci
cp .env.example .env
npm run dev
```

## Before Opening a Pull Request

Run:
```bash
npm run lint
npx tsc --noEmit
```

For verification or settlement changes, document the failure behavior as well as the success path.

## Commit Style

Examples:

```text
feat: add verified risk decision trace
fix: prevent duplicate recovery actions
test: cover retrieval fallback behavior
docs: clarify local setup
refactor: isolate policy evaluation
```

## Pull Request Expectations

A strong pull request should include:

- what changed and why
- screenshots for meaningful UI changes
- tests or validation steps
- any migration or environment changes
- security or safety implications, if relevant

Please keep unrelated changes out of the same pull request so reviews stay fast and focused.
